Now... to start building. ðŸ™Œ

As far as I know, here's what I need to do:

1. Find raw posts from Bear (stored in iCloud)
2. Get the posts specifically tagged `#public`
3. Copy those posts to my website's repo and convert them to markdown files
4. Clean up the formatting
5. Commit/push to publish them
6. Detect when I add `#public` to a note in Bear; publish it to my site
7. Detect when I remove `#public` from a note; remove it from my site
8. Automate everything

I mentioned [pybear](https://github.com/redspider/pybear) in my last post. It was built to handle tasks 1 to 3 and once you have [python3](https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how-to-upgrade-your-mac-to-python-3), it works great.

*Markdown files!*

Running `jekyll serve` doesn't render these as new pages though. My post files have to follow this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. I fixed this (and other formatting issues) in [my own fork of pybear](https://github.com/ellenli/pybear).
