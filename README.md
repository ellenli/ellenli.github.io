# Welcome!

Here are the innards behind my home on the web: http://ellen.li.

As of December 2016, the website is on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and styled with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Prior to that, my website was hosted on a VPS; it was one static page built with raw HTML and CSS (and before _that_, my website ran on Wordpress).

Feel free to fork this for your tinkering/learning purposes.

Got a questions? Reach me by [email](mailto:me@ellen.li) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ellenxli).
