# Welcome!

Here are the innards behind my home on the web, http://ellen.li.

As of December 2016, the website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and styled with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Prior to that, my website was hosted on a VPS. It was one static page built with raw HTML and CSS. Feel free to fork this for your tinkering/learning purposes.

Questions? Reach me by [email](mailto:me@ellen.li) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ellenxli).
